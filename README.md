# LaneNet (Pytorch Implementaiton)

An Pytorch implementation of for real time lane detection based on ["Towards End-to-End Lane Detection: an Instance Segmentation Approach"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05591.pdf) which was featured in CVPR workshop for being 3rd place in the [TuSimple Lane Detection competition](http://benchmark.tusimple.ai/#/).
